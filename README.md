## Description

Did 3 exercises, two were designing solutions to simple math problems. The third was debugging several strings of code.

## What I Learned from This

Learned how to recall numbers or words using %. Learned more about how to correctly phrase math equations (sin(x)^2, not sin^2(x))

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.
